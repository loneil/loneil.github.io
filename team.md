After our first year we have learned a few valuable lessons:

1. Teams don’t want to have to use a large platform service when all they need is one small piece of it.
1. Teams want the flexibility to decide how to use the common component. That might mean they just want to make a webservice call.  But it could also be the case that they want to host their own instance, or assembly the various code packages themselves to combine them with other custom-built packages. Allowing for those options will increase your customer base.
1. If it costs more to onboard to the service and start using the common component than to build a similar component themselves, then they are just going to build it themselves. So, there has to be an immediate ROI for the teams that are going to us it.
1. Don’t start building something without having your first customer lined up.
1. Your first customer should understand that the goal is to build something that will be used by others, so their unique requirements and business specific configurations will be kept separate from the common component.
1. Relentlessly defend your approach to build and maintain a modernized technology architecture (e.g. open source, microservices, cloud native, serverless). The developer team will run away from anything else. The common components will be left on the shelf if they’re yesterday’s tools. This means you have to keep your components up to date.
1. If you’re not up to the task of providing operational support for the life of the component, then you are better off not building the tool at all.
1. As soon as you’re done building something, people will come and tell you about a product that already does that.  Don’t worry, just collect the feedback and keep moving forward. There will always be other tools that do similar things. Having choices is ok.
