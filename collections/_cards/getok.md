Get Token (GETOK) is fundamentally a tool to automate the process for providing teams access (via client credentials) to Common Services.  Use GETOK to promote your access through the various environments: DEV/INT, TEST, and PROD.

#### Keycloak
Use GETOK to create a service client for your application to interact with Keycloak protected Common Services ([CHES](#CHES), [CDOGS](#CDOGS)).  

#### WebADE Legacy
With special permissions, GETOK can provide credentials for Legacy WebADE protected Common Services.
