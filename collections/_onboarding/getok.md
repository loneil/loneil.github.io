#### API Access through GETOK

Get Token (GETOK) is fundamentally a tool to automate the process for providing teams access (via client credentials) to Common Services. Use GETOK to promote your access through the various environments: DEV, TEST, and PROD.

###### Available  Components:
- Common Hosted Email Service
- Common Document Generation Service

##### How To

###### Step 1 Create an account for your application
Click the “GETOK” button to onboard and submit the “Request Account” form with the Acronym of your application, you will get an email once it is approved. Follow the link provided in your email, your application will be ready to register.

###### Step 2 Register your application
If you followed the email link and your don’t see the application ready, please log out and log back in. The registration for API access is designed in order of Dev - Test - Prod environment. When you proceed for the Dev environment, you need to enter your application’s full name and the description. This information will be saved for the next time so you or your team member doesn’t need to input every time.

###### Step 3 Access to API
Once you follow the steps, you will have the API Access, make sure you save the password secuerly as you won’t be able to fetch it again (or you can get a new password by repeating the process).
